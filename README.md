# RocketLeagueRanks
Old project that no longer works!

This is a small python program that finds your mmr and the mmr needed to get to the next rank/tier.  
All data is found through https://rocketleague.tracker.network/ due to the lack of a public API.  
It is a WIP. (The program is just for me, but here it is if someone happens to find it)

## To Run
If you have python (I am running python 3.8 on Windows 10 64 bit), you can run the python file.   
I recommend running the program with the .pyw extension to hide the console.  
I will also update the dist folder to contain an up to date executable version of the program.

## How it works
Type your (or someone else's) Steam ID/Custom URL name, Xbox gamertag, or PSN.  
Choose either 1s, 2s, or 3s ranked.  
Choose the platform that corresponds with the Rocket League account.  

## Output
In the middle, you will see your current mmr in the selected mode.  
On the left, you will find the mmr needed to get into the next tier. (Ex. Platinum, Diamond)   
On the right, you will find the mmr needed to get into the next rank. (Platinum I, Platinum II, Platinum III).
